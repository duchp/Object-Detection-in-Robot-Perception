# Object-Detection-in-Robot-Perception(Hand Gesture Recognition)
## two-simple_ssd  
The hand gesture recognition plays an important role in the human-robot interaction (HRI) field. Most previous researches only investigate hand gesture recognition in a short distance, which is not able to be used for interaction with mobile robots like unmanned aerial vehicles in a longer distance. Therefore, we investigate the problem of long-range hand gesture recognition. We proposed a cascaded SSD structure for the long-range hand gesture recognition. Our model employed two SSDs for object detection. One is for the head-shoulder region detection and the other is for the hand gesture bounding box proposal and classification.
